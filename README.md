Question:--
Multi-cloud process failover: Design a predictive mechanism where, in case a potential low-performance of a process is predicted (such as, due to low potential resource availability), then the process fails over from one cloud to another. Design the failover mechanism in a container-
based paradigm.

====> What we have done in this project:-
      1> Prediction of failure is done using Logistic Regeression based on previous performance metric.
      2> If failure is predicted then, the process is transferred from one cloud to another.
      3> This mechanism is designed using container based paridgm.

The above mentioned Research Paper are the ones from which we have taken help.
