# Cloud-Computing-Project
Question:--
Multi-cloud process failover: Design a predictive mechanism where, in case a potential low-performance of a process is predicted (such as, due to low potential resource availability), then the process fails over from one cloud to another. Design the failover mechanism in a container-
based paradigm.

====> What we have done in this project:-
      1> Prediction of failure is done using Logistic Regeression based on previous performance metric.
      2> If failure is predicted then, the process is transferred from one cloud to another.
      3> This mechanism is designed using container based paridgm.

Failure prediction is necessary for predictive maintenance due to its ability to prevent failure incidents and maintenance costs.Predictive maintenance is about anticipating failures and taking proactive actions. Recent advances in machine learning and cloud storage have created a great opportunity to utilize the huge amount of data generated from cloud infrastructures which provides room to predict when a component is likely to malfunction or fail. Currently, mathematical and statistical modeling are the prominent approaches used for failure predictions, these are based on equipment degradation physical models and machine learning techniques, respectively.According to, Cloud computing is usually associated with failures. The risk of failure can be viewed as the possibility of suffering loss, or exposure in the cloud-computing life cycle.Generally, cloud computing risk management consists of processes, approaches, and techniques that are employed to reduce cloud computing risks failure.Although, much research and advancement have been carried out in this area cloud, some companies have suffered a huge amount of downtime as a result of cloud failure which has led to a significant revenue loss.
